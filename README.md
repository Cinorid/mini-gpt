## Pocketbase:

[Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) is used to store the prompts. Keep the `VITE_PROMPT_ENDPOINT` env var as an empty string if you do not want to use this feature.

Copy over the code from `pocket-base/main.pb.ts` onto your pocketbase server. [Instructions on extending pocket base via pb-hooks](https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-overview). Don't forget to restart the pb service.

## Cloudflare

Copy and paste the code in `cloudflare/index.ts` to your Cloudflare function.

## Frontend:

1. Run `mv .env.example .env` to create a new .env file
1. Update the values with your cloudflare function and pocket base URL

Then you know the drill, `yarn i`, `yarn dev`.
